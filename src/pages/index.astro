        It’s 2022, but Tom still opens and reads PDFs like it’s 2010; stored in different folders (docs, school, downloads etc... gosh! how does Tom
        survive?), looks through his file manager or that other app we won’t mention every-time to find a file “conveniently” named
        “writing_interpreters (1).pdf”. That’s where Reda (pronounced as Reader; easy) comes in, still don’t understand? I don’t either, so let’s go
        back a bit more. Remember those days when you would download movies from the web or get it from a friend (probably because you couldn’t find
        it on the streaming platform you pay for; or that other reason you know), and you would have to battle with a video player to get it to show
        up with a terrible thumbnail, you’d play it and then it’d hit you “$hit, I need the subtitle!” and then you try to find one that matches your
        version for minutes and when you think you have, you have to import it into that video player and then you would have to tinker with the
        settings and slow it down a bit for a manageable experience... and then came along Infuse; download, import it into Infuse any of the many
        ways you can and then you’d open the app to find a streaming app’s library-like experience; the right thumbnail, cast details, movie ‘plot’,
        subtitles, ratings etc! Now that you get the picture, Reda simply brings a similar experience to your digital books!
