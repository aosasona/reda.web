				It‚Äôs 2022, but Tom still opens and reads PDFs like it‚Äôs 2010; stored in different folders (docs, school, downloads etc... gosh! how does Tom survive?), looks through his file manager or that other app we won‚Äôt mention every-time to find a file ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù named
				‚Äúwriting_interpreters (1).pdf‚Äù. That‚Äôs where Reda (pronounced as Reader; easy) comes in, still don‚Äôt understand? I don‚Äôt either, so let‚Äôs go back a bit more. Remember those days when you would download movies from the web or get it from a friend (probably because you couldn‚Äôt find it
				on the streaming platform you pay for; or that other reason you know), and you would have to battle with a video player to get it to show up with a terrible thumbnail, you‚Äôd play it and then it‚Äôd hit you ‚Äú$hit, I need the subtitle!‚Äù and then you try to find one that matches your
				version for minutes and when you think you have, you have to import it into that video player and then you would have to tinker with the settings and slow it down a bit for a manageable experience... and then came along Infuse; download, import it into Infuse any of the many ways you
				can and then you‚Äôd open the app to find a streaming app‚Äôs library-like experience; the right thumbnail, cast details, movie ‚Äòplot‚Äô, subtitles, ratings etc! Now that you get the picture, Reda simply brings a similar experience to your digital documents!
